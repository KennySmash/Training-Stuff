# JavaScript Mastery Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core JavaScript with Node.js or Deno (Months 1-3)
Focus on learning raw JavaScript skills using Node.js or Deno without a browser environment.

### Month 1: Core JavaScript Syntax and Concepts

- **Topics:**
  - Variables, Data Types, and Operators (var, let, const)
  - Functions (function declaration, expression, arrow functions)
  - Conditionals (if-else, switch)
  - Loops (for, while, forEach)
  - Error Handling (try-catch)
  - Event Loop and asynchronous behavior
- **Tools:** Node.js/Deno, VSCode, Terminal
- **Project:** CLI-based To-Do app

### Month 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts
- **Objective:** Dive deeper into JavaScript functions and data structures.
- **Topics:**
  - Arrays and Objects (CRUD operations, methods like map, reduce, filter)
  - Higher-order Functions
  - Closures and Scope
  - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
  - Modules (Import/Export)
  - Promises and async/await
- **Project:** CLI program to fetch and parse data from an API (e.g., GitHub users API)

### Month 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Objective:** Master OOP concepts in JavaScript using Node.js or Deno.
- **Topics:**
  - Constructor Functions and Prototypes
  - ES6 Classes
  - Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism
  - Working with the file system in Node.js/Deno
- **Project:** User Management System (CRUD operations with JSON files)

## Phase 2: Debugging and Profiling (Months 4-5)
Learn how to debug and optimize your JavaScript code effectively.

### Month 4: Debugging JavaScript
- **Objective:** Master debugging techniques in Node.js/Deno and browser environments.
- **Topics:**
  - Console logging (`console.log`, `console.error`, `console.table`)
  - Node.js debugger (`node inspect`)
  - Debugging with VSCode (breakpoints, watch expressions)
  - Error handling strategies (try/catch)
  - Chrome DevTools for debugging browser-based JavaScript
- **Project:** Refactor and debug a previous CLI project.

### Month 5: Profiling and Performance Optimization
- **Objective:** Learn how to profile and optimize your JavaScript code for better performance.
- **Topics:**
  - Node.js profiling using `--prof`
  - Memory leaks and garbage collection
  - Chrome DevTools for profiling performance
  - Time complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- **Project:** Optimize the API-fetching CLI project.

## Phase 3: Implementing JavaScript in Webpages (Months 6-8)
Work with JavaScript in the browser to manipulate the DOM and handle web interactions.

### Month 6: DOM Manipulation and Event Handling
- **Objective:** Learn how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and handles user input.
- **Topics:**
  - DOM manipulation (querySelector, getElementById)
  - Event handling (click, keydown, hover)
  - Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX, Fetch API)
- **Project:** Interactive Quiz or Form Validation with pure JavaScript.

### Month 7: Advanced Browser APIs
- **Objective:** Use modern browser APIs to enhance JavaScript functionality.
- **Topics:**
  - localStorage and sessionStorage for data persistence
  - JSON manipulation
  - Fetch API for HTTP requests
  - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
  - Web Workers for background processing
- **Project:** Personal Task Manager with localStorage.

### Month 8: Modular Web JavaScript
- **Objective:** Structure front-end JavaScript using ES6 modules and advanced features.
- **Topics:**
  - ES6 modules and bundling tools (Webpack, Rollup)
  - Client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPA)
  - Shadow DOM and Web Components
- **Project:** Single Page Application (SPA) that fetches data from an external API.

## Phase 4: JavaScript Backends with Node.js or Deno (Months 9-12)
Master back-end development using JavaScript to build powerful server-side applications.

### Month 9: Introduction to Backend Development
- **Objective:** Use Node.js or Deno to build simple back-end servers.
- **Topics:**
  - HTTP servers with Node.js or Deno
  - Routing and handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Introduction to Express (Node.js) or Oak (Deno)
- **Project:** Build a simple CRUD API.

### Month 10: Databases and APIs
- **Objective:** Connect JavaScript back-ends to databases and build RESTful APIs.
- **Topics:**
  - SQL or NoSQL databases (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
  - RESTful API design principles
  - Authentication (JWT)
- **Project:** RESTful API with CRUD functionality connected to a database.

### Month 11: Advanced Backend Development
- **Objective:** Build more advanced server applications with middleware and real-time communication.
- **Topics:**
  - Middleware in Express or Oak
  - Error handling and logging in back-end applications
  - WebSockets for real-time communication
- **Project:** Real-time chat application using WebSockets.

### Month 12: Full-Stack Project and Deployment
- **Objective:** Combine front-end and back-end JavaScript to create and deploy full-stack applications.
- **Topics:**
  - Full-stack development with React or vanilla JS front-end and Node.js/Deno back-end
